# learn-valorant
For my UI Design midterm, I designed a website hosting Valorant content for new players to learn the game. Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQDGyhmMvpg&amp;t=1s

To run the website, 
-Install Python and Flask 
-Open a terminal in the root of the website and run "python server.py"
-Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
